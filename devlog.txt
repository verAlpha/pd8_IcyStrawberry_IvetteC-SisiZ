This weekend we made the github repo and we came up with our projet idea. 
We made an outline of the classes we will be writing and  the methods in it.
After making the outline, we started working on the classes.

Today we began writing the Board and Character classes
    Character will have subclasses of: Player, and ComputerPlayer
        Sisi wrote the several methods in the character, such as move and roll.
        Ivette started working on the Player subclass and wrote the method buyProperties.
    Board will mostly be a cirully liked list of the locations on the board
        the nodes of which are modified singlly liked lists
    Some sort of driver function will also be needed to connect all the classes together.

Today we continued working on the Character and Player class. We also started a Driver class.
    At first, we looked over what each of us did.
    In the Character class, we added the much necessary accesor and mutator methods.
    In the Player class, we modified the buyProperty method and added a askBuy method.
