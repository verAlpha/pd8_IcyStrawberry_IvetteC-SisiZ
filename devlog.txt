This weekend we made the github repo and we came up with our projet idea. 
We made an outline of the classes we will be writing and  the methods in it.
After making the outline, we started working on the classes.

Today we began writing the Board and Character classes
    Character will have subclasses of: Player, and Character
        Sisi wrote the move method in the player.
    Board will mostly be a cirully liked list of the locations on the board
        the nodes of which are modified singlly liked lists
    Some sort of driver function will also be needed to connect all the classes together.
