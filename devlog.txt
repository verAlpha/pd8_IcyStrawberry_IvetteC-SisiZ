This weekend we made the github repo and we came up with our projet idea. 
We made an outline of the classes we will be writing and  the methods in it.
After making the outline, we started working on the classes.

Today we began writing the Board and Character classes
    Character will have subclasses of: Player, and Character
    Board will mostly be a cirully liked list of the locations on the board
        the nodes of which are modified singlly liked lists
    Some sort of driver function will also be needed    
    While working on the Board constructer, 
        we realize that there was a better way of creating some kind of circle list linked
        without having to copy and paste it, but as of now, it seemed easier to copy and paste it
        rather than to write a for loop node and to do the same thing.
        However, we do have in mind of changing it to the for loop node after getting the basics done.
