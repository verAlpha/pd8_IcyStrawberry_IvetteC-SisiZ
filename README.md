======================
Overall idea (a la abstract). In a brief paragraph, give overview of project.
  We plan to make a game similar to Monopoly. It it will have a board class, a bank class that keeps track of the moeny, a class that makes a player move, a class that increases or decreases a players amount of money, and a class that helps a player move. 
User experience. What will user see, interact with? What will user be expected to know? What is userâ€™s goal, etc?
  The user will see a command line window. At the beginning, he is asked to give a name he would like to be called. Afterwards, we display some sort of map or image of the board. After each turn, we let the user know where which player is. The goal of the game is have the most money out of all the players. A game is determined after all territories have been claimed or when the user has lest than a certain number of money.
Topics incorporated. Which APCS2 topics are your incorporating, and how?
  1.CLList: will be used in the board class. By using CLList, players would go around the board until the end of the game.
  2.Interface class: there will be a Player interface class, which methods would be implemented in a User class and a ComputerPlayer class.
Anticipated hurdles. Where do you anticipate having to invest time learn a new skill, re-learn an old one, etc.?
  We believe that we're going to have troubles with the board adn connecting everything together. We also believe that we might have some difficulties with CLList and might have to solidify are understanding in it.
